{/* upon researching ive decided to split the page to be modular, this is 
is the main purpose of react, keeping to an atomic structure...
each component(or function) to handle only one output...
the use of state means only one function is called at a time and updated as needed
this leads to superior UI's that are literally "reactive" "responsive"  */}
